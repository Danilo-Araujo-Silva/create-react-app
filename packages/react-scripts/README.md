# react-scripts-kt

## Project Current State
The current state of this project is proof of concept.

In any case it is already possible to create a Kotlin application based on the
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app),
but only for development purposes.

## How to Use

	yarn global add create-react-app
	create-react-app --scripts-version react-scripts-kt
	
Enjoy!
